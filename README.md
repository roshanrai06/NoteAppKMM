# NoteAppKMM

KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) allows us to create cross-platform apps using Kotlin. A major part of our apps logic is shared Kotlin code - only the platform specific things need to be implemented in native code. So, we effectively get 2 native apps while sharing a lot of Kotlin code.
